🧠 Developer Notes
Auth should use NextAuth with roles embedded in JWT/session

Role-based access middleware should protect:

Admin dashboard

API routes (/api/admin/*, /api/ai/*)

Use RBAC pattern (Role-Based Access Control)

Consider adding trust score, email verification, or reputation later for user ranking
